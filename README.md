# AdsBannerMax

This is a minimal application, only featuring an activity. It is meant to be
cloned to study energy consumption of the AppLovin MAX advertising third-party libraries.

## Scenario

The `scenario.sh` script allows you to automatically run the application.

It will automatically launch the app and wait a defined amount of time to load ads.

To use it, make sure you have `adb` installed and an Android device with dev mode plugged-in.
